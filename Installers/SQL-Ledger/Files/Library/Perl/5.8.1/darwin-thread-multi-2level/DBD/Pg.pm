=head1 NAME

DBD::Pg - PostgreSQL database driver for the DBI module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DBI;

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname", "", "", {AutoCommit => 0});

  # For some advanced uses you may need PostgreSQL type values:
  use DBD::Pg qw(:pg_types);

  # See the DBI module documentation for full details

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBD::Pg is a Perl module that works with the DBI module to provide access to
PostgreSQL databases.

=head1 MODULE DOCUMENTATION

This documentation describes driver specific behavior and restrictions. It is
not supposed to be used as the only reference for the user. In any case
consult the L<DBI|DBI> documentation first!

=head1 THE DBI CLASS

=head2 DBI Class Methods

=over 4

=item B<connect>

To connect to a database with a minimum of parameters, use the following
syntax:

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname", "", "");

This connects to the database $dbname at localhost without any user
authentication. This is sufficient for the defaults of PostgreSQL (excluding
some package-installed versions).

The following connect statement shows almost all possible parameters:

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname;host=$host;port=$port;" .
                      "options=$options", "$username", "$password",
                      {AutoCommit => 0});

If a parameter is undefined PostgreSQL first looks for specific environment
variables and then it uses hard-coded defaults:

  parameter  environment variable  hard coded default
  --------------------------------------------------
  host       PGHOST                local domain socket
  hostaddr*  PGHOSTADDR            local domain socket
  port       PGPORT                5432
  dbname**   PGDATABASE            current userid
  username   PGUSER                current userid
  password   PGPASSWORD            ""
  options    PGOPTIONS             ""
  service*   PGSERVICE             ""
  sslmode*   PGSSLMODE             ""

* Only for servers running version 7.4 or greater

** Can also use "db" or "database"

The options parameter specifies runtime options for the Postgres
backend. Common usage is to increase the number of buffers with the C<-B>
option. Also important is the C<-F> option, which disables automatic fsync()
call after each transaction. For further details please refer to the
PostgreSQL documentation at L<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/>.

For authentication with username and password, appropriate entries have to be
made in F<pg_hba.conf>. Please refer to the comments in the F<pg_hba.conf> and
the F<pg_passwd> files for the different types of authentication. Note that
for these two parameters DBI distinguishes between empty and undefined. If
these parameters are undefined DBI substitutes the values of the environment
variables C<DBI_USER> and C<DBI_PASS> if present.

=item B<available_drivers>

  @driver_names = DBI->available_drivers;

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<data_sources>

  @data_sources = DBI->data_sources('Pg');

This driver supports this method. Note that the necessary database connection
to the database "template1" will be made on the localhost without any user
authentication. Other preferences can only be set with the environment
variables C<PGHOST>, C<PGPORT>, C<DBI_USER>, and C<DBI_PASS>.

=back

=head1 METHODS COMMON TO ALL HANDLES

=over 4

=item B<err>

  $rv = $h->err;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. For the connect method it returns
C<PQstatus>. In all other cases it returns C<PQresultStatus> of the current
handle.

=item B<errstr>

  $str = $h->errstr;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. It returns the C<PQerrorMessage>
related to the current handle.

=item B<state>

  $str = $h->state;

Supported by this driver. Returns a five-character "SQLSTATE" code.
PostgreSQL servers version 7.4 or less will always return a generic 
"S1000" code. Success is indicated by a "00000" code.

The list of codes used by PostgreSQL can be found at:
L<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/errcodes-appendix.html>

=item B<trace>

  $h->trace($trace_level, $trace_filename);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<trace_msg>

  $h->trace_msg($message_text);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<func>

This driver supports a variety of driver specific functions accessible via the
C<func> method. Note that the name of the function comes last, after the arguments.

=over

=item table_attributes

  $attrs = $dbh->func($table, 'table_attributes');

The C<table_attributes> function is no longer recommended. Instead,
you can use the more portable C<column_info> and C<primary_key> methods
to access the same information.

The C<table_attributes> method returns, for the given table argument, a 
reference to an array of hashes, each of which contains the following keys:

  NAME        attribute name
  TYPE        attribute type
  SIZE        attribute size (-1 for variable size)
  NULLABLE    flag nullable
  DEFAULT     default value
  CONSTRAINT  constraint
  PRIMARY_KEY flag is_primary_key
  REMARKS     attribute description

The REMARKS field will be returned as C<NULL> for Postgres versions 7.1.x and
older.

=item lo_create

  $lobjId = $dbh->func($mode, 'lo_creat');

Creates a new large object and returns the object-id. $mode is a bitmask
describing different attributes of the new object. Use the following
constants:

  $dbh->{pg_INV_WRITE}
  $dbh->{pg_INV_READ}

Upon failure it returns C<undef>.

=item lo_open

  $lobj_fd = $dbh->func($lobjId, $mode, 'lo_open');

Opens an existing large object and returns an object-descriptor for use in
subsequent C<lo_*> calls. For the mode bits see C<lo_create>. Returns C<undef>
upon failure. Note that 0 is a perfectly correct object descriptor!

=item lo_write

  $nbytes = $dbh->func($lobj_fd, $buf, $len, 'lo_write');

Writes $len bytes of $buf into the large object $lobj_fd. Returns the number
of bytes written and C<undef> upon failure.

=item lo_read

  $nbytes = $dbh->func($lobj_fd, $buf, $len, 'lo_read');

Reads $len bytes into $buf from large object $lobj_fd. Returns the number of
bytes read and C<undef> upon failure.

=item lo_lseek

  $loc = $dbh->func($lobj_fd, $offset, $whence, 'lo_lseek');

Changes the current read or write location on the large object
$obj_id. Currently $whence can only be 0 (C<L_SET>). Returns the current
location and C<undef> upon failure.

=item lo_tell

  $loc = $dbh->func($lobj_fd, 'lo_tell');

Returns the current read or write location on the large object $lobj_fd and
C<undef> upon failure.

=item lo_close

  $lobj_fd = $dbh->func($lobj_fd, 'lo_close');

Closes an existing large object. Returns true upon success and false upon
failure.

=item lo_unlink

  $ret = $dbh->func($lobjId, 'lo_unlink');

Deletes an existing large object. Returns true upon success and false upon
failure.

=item lo_import

  $lobjId = $dbh->func($filename, 'lo_import');

Imports a Unix file as large object and returns the object id of the new
object or C<undef> upon failure.

=item lo_export

  $ret = $dbh->func($lobjId, $filename, 'lo_export');

Exports a large object into a Unix file. Returns false upon failure, true
otherwise.

=item putline

  $ret = $dbh->func($line, 'putline');

Used together with the SQL-command C<COPY table FROM STDIN> to copy large
amount of data into a table avoiding the overhead of using single
insert commands. The application must explicitly send the two characters "\."
to indicate to the backend that it has finished sending its data.

=item getline

  $ret = $dbh->func($buffer, length, 'getline');

Used together with the SQL-command C<COPY table TO STDOUT> to dump a complete
table.

=item pg_notifies

  $ret = $dbh->func('pg_notifies');

Returns either C<undef> or a reference to two-element array [ $table,
$backend_pid ] of asynchronous notifications received.

=item getfd

  $fd = $dbh->func('getfd');

Returns fd of the actual connection to server. Can be used with select() and
func('pg_notifies'). Deprecated in favor of C<< $dbh->{pg_socket} >>.

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<prepare>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, \%attr);

Prepares a statement for later execution. PostgreSQL supports prepared
statements, which enables DBD::Pg to only send the query once, and
simply send the arguments for every subsequent call to execute().
DBD::Pg can use these server-side prepared statements, or it can
just send the entire query to the server each time. The best way
is automatically chosen for each query. This will be sufficient for
most users: keep reading for a more detailed explanation and some
optional flags.

Deciding whether or not to use prepared statements depends on many
factors, but you can force them to be used or not used by passing
the C<pg_server_prepare> attribute to prepare(). A "0" means to never
use prepared statements. This is the default when connected to servers
earlier than version 7.4, which is when prepared statements were introduced.
Setting C<pg_server_prepare> to "1" means that prepared statements
should be used whenever possible. This is the default for servers
version 7.4 or higher. This attribute can also be set at connection
time like so:

  $dbh = DBI->connect($DBNAME, $DBUSER, $DBPASS,
                      { AutoCommit => 0,
                        RaiseError => 1,
                        pg_server_prepare => 0 });

or you may set it after your database handle is created:

  $dbh->{pg_server_prepare} = 1;

To enable it for just one particular statement:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT id FROM mytable WHERE val = ?",
                       { pg_server_prepare => 1 });

You can even toggle between the two as you go:

  $sth->{pg_server_prepare} = 1;
  $sth->execute(22);
  $sth->{pg_server_prepare} = 0;
  $sth->execute(44);
  $sth->{pg_server_prepare} = 1;
  $sth->execute(66);

In the above example, the first execute will use the previously prepared statement.
The second execute will not, but will build the query into a single string and send
it to the server. The third one will act like the first and only send the arguments.
Even if you toggle back and forth, a statement is only prepared once.

Using prepared statements is in theory quite a bit faster: not only does the
PostgreSQL backend only have to prepare the query only once, but DBD::Pg no
longer has to worry about quoting each value before sending it to the server.

However, there are some drawbacks. The server cannot always choose the ideal
parse plan because it will not know the arguments before hand. But for most
situations in which you will be executing similar data many times, the default
plan will probably work out well. Further discussion on this subject is beyond
the scope of this documentation: please consult the pgsql-performance mailing
list, L<http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/>

If you are using DBD::Pg with 7.4 libraries, you must set the parameter for
each placeholder using bind_param() in order to use prepared statements. This
can be a big hassle: upgrading to 8.0 is highly recommended.

Only certain commands will be sent to a server-side prepare: currently these
include C<SELECT>, C<INSERT>, C<UPDATE>, and C<DELETE>. DBD::Pg uses a simple
naming scheme for the prepared statements: C<dbdpg_#>, where "#" starts at 1 and
increases. This number is tracked at the database handle level, so multiple
statement handles will not collide. If you use your own prepare statements, do
not name them "dbdpg_"!

The actual C<PREPARE> is not performed until the first execute is called, due
to the fact that information on the data types (provided by C<bind_param>) may
be given after the prepare but before the execute.

A server-side prepare can also happen before the first execute. If the server can
handle the server-side prepare and the statement has no placeholders, it will
be prepared right away. It will also be prepared if the C<pg_prepare_now> attribute
is passed. Similarly, the <pg_prepare_now> attribute can be set to 0 to ensure that
the statement is B<not> prepared immediately, although cases in which you would
want this may be rare. Finally, you can set the default behavior of all prepare
statements by setting the C<pg_prepare_now> attribute on the database handle:

  $dbh->{pg_prepare_now} = 1;

The following two examples will be prepared right away:

  $sth->prepare("SELECT 123"); ## no placeholders

  $sth->prepare("SELECT 123, ?", {pg_prepare_now = 1});

The following two examples will NOT be prepared right away:

  $sth->prepare("SELECT 123, ?"); ## has a placeholder

  $sth->prepare("SELECT 123", {pg_prepare_now = 0});

There are times when you may want to prepare a statement yourself. To do this,
simply send the C<PREPARE> statement directly to the server (e.g. with
"do"). Create a statement handle and set the prepared name via
C<pg_prepare_name> attribute. The statement handle can be created with a dummy
statement, as it will not be executed. However, it should have the same
number of placeholders as your prepared statement. Example:

  $dbh->do("PREPARE mystat AS SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE reltuples < ?");
  $sth = $dbh->prepare("ABC ?");
  $sth->bind_param(1, 1, SQL_INTEGER);
  $sth->{pg_prepare_name} = "mystat";
  $sth->execute(123);

The above will run this query:

  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE reltuples < 123;

Note: DBD::Pg will not escape your custom prepared statement name, so don't
use a name that needs escaping! DBD::Pg uses the prepare names C<dbdpg_#>
internally, so please do not use those either.

You can force DBD::Pg to send your query directly to the server by adding
the C<pg_direct> attribute to your prepare call. This is not recommended,
but is added just in case you need it.

=item B<Placeholders>

There are three types of placeholders that can be used in DBD::Pg. The first is
the question mark method, in which each placeholder is represented by a single
question mark. This is the method recommended by the DBI specs and is the most
portable. Each question mark is replaced by a "dollar sign number" in the order
in which they appear in the query (important when using C<bind_param>).

The second method is to use "dollar sign numbers" directly. This is the method
that PostgreSQL uses internally and is overall probably the best method to use
if you do not need compatibility with other database systems. DBD::Pg, like
PostgreSQL, allows the same number to be used more than once in the query.
Numbers must start with "1" and increment by one value. If the same number
appears more than once in a query, it is treated as a single parameter and all
instances are replaced at once. Examples:

Not legal:

  $SQL = "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > $2";

  $SQL = "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $1 AND $3";

Legal:

  $SQL = "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > $1";

  $SQL = "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $1 AND $2";

  $SQL = "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND reltuples > $1";

  $SQL = "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > $1 AND reltuples > $1";

In the final statement above, DBI thinks there is only one placeholder, so this
statement will replace both placeholders:

  $sth->bind_param(1, 2045);

While execute requires only a single argument as well:

  $sth->execute(2045);

The final placeholder method is the named parameters in the format ":foo". While this
syntax is supported by DBD::Pg, its use is highly discouraged.

The different types of placeholders cannot be mixed within a statement, but you may
use different ones for each statement handle you have. Again, this is not encouraged.

=item B<prepare_cached>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare_cached($statement, \%attr);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact. This method is most useful
when using a server that supports server-side prepares, and you have asked
the prepare to happen immediately via the C<pg_prepare_now> attribute.

=item B<do>

  $rv  = $dbh->do($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Prepare and execute a single statement. Because statements with placeholders
should be calling prepare and execute themselves, calls to C<do()> will not
use server-side prepares by default. You can force the use of server-side
prepares by adding C<pg_server_prepare => 1> to the attribute hashref. See the
notes on C<prepare>, C<bind_param>, and C<execute> for more information.

=item B<last_insert_id>

  $rv = $dbh->last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field);
  $rv = $dbh->last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field, \%attr);

Attempts to return the id of the last value to be inserted into a table.
You can either provide a sequence name (preferred) or provide a table
name with optional schema. The $catalog and $field arguments are always ignored.
The current value of the sequence is returned by a call to the
C<CURRVAL()> PostgreSQL function. This will fail if the sequence has not yet
been used in the current database connection.

If you do not know the name of the sequence, you can provide a table name and
DBD::Pg will attempt to return the correct value. To do this, there must be at
least one column in the table with a C<NOT NULL> constraint, that has a unique
constraint, and which uses a sequence as a default value. If more than one column
meets these conditions, the primary key will be used. This involves some
looking up of things in the system table, so DBD::Pg will cache the sequence
name for susequent calls. If you need to disable this caching for some reason,
you can control it via the C<pg_cache> attribute.

Please keep in mind that this method is far from foolproof, so make your
script use it properly. Specifically, make sure that it is called
immediately after the insert, and that the insert does not add a value
to the column that is using the sequence as a default value.

Some examples:

  $dbh->do("CREATE SEQUENCE lii_seq START 1");
  $dbh->do("CREATE TABLE lii (
    foobar INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE DEFAULT nextval('lii_seq'),
    baz VARCHAR)");
  $SQL = "INSERT INTO lii(baz) VALUES (?)";
  $sth = $dbh->prepare($SQL);
  for (qw(uno dos tres cuatro)) {
    $sth->execute($_);
    my $newid = $dbh->last_insert_id(C<undef>,undef,undef,undef,{sequence=>'lii_seq'});
    print "Last insert id was $newid\n";
  }

If you did not want to worry about the sequence name:

  $dbh->do("CREATE TABLE lii2 (
    foobar SERIAL UNIQUE,
    baz VARCHAR)");
  $SQL = "INSERT INTO lii2(baz) VALUES (?)";
  $sth = $dbh->prepare($SQL);
  for (qw(uno dos tres cuatro)) {
    $sth->execute($_);
    my $newid = $dbh->last_insert_id(undef,undef,"lii2",undef);
    print "Last insert id was $newid\n";
  }

=item B<commit>

  $rc  = $dbh->commit;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. See also the notes about
B<Transactions> elsewhere in this document.

=item B<rollback>

  $rc  = $dbh->rollback;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. See also the notes about
B<Transactions> elsewhere in this document.

=item B<disconnect>

  $rc  = $dbh->disconnect;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<ping>

  $rc = $dbh->ping;

This driver supports the C<ping> method, which can be used to check the validity
of a database handle. The C<ping> method issues an empty query and checks the
result status.

=item B<column_info>

  $sth = $dbh->column_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, $column );

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI with the follow exceptions.
These fields are currently always returned with NULL (C<undef>) values:

   TABLE_CAT
   BUFFER_LENGTH
   DECIMAL_DIGITS
   NUM_PREC_RADIX
   SQL_DATA_TYPE
   SQL_DATETIME_SUB
   CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH

Also, two additional non-standard fields are returned:

  pg_type - data type with additional info i.e. "character varying(20)"
  pg_constraint - holds column constraint definition

The REMARKS field will be returned as NULL (C<undef> for PostgreSQL versions 
older than 7.2. The TABLE_SCHEM field will be returned as NULL (C<undef>) for 
versions older than 7.4.

=item B<table_info>

  $sth = $dbh->table_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, $type );

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. This method returns all tables
and views visible to the current user. The $catalog argument is currently
unused. The schema and table arguments will do a C<LIKE> search if a percent 
sign (C<%>) or an underscore (C<_>) is detected in the argument. The $type 
argument accepts a value of either "TABLE" or "VIEW" (using both is the 
default action).

The TABLE_CAT field will always return NULL (C<undef>). The TABLE_SCHEM field 
returns NULL (C<undef>) if the server is older than version 7.4.

If your database supports tablespaces (version 8.0 or greater), two additional
columns are returned, "pg_tablespace_name" and "pg_tablespace_location",
that contain the name and location of the tablespace associated with
this table. Tables that have not been assigned to a particular tablespace
will return NULL (C<undef>) for both of these columns.

=item B<primary_key_info>

  $sth = $dbh->primary_key_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, \%attr );

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. The $catalog argument is
currently unused, and the $schema argument has no effect against
servers running version 7.2 or older. There are no search patterns allowed,
but leaving the $schema argument blank will cause the first table
found in the schema search path to be used. An additional field, "DATA_TYPE",
is returned and shows the data type for each of the arguments in the
"COLUMN_NAME" field.

This method will also return tablespace information for servers that support
tablespaces. See the C<table_info> entry for more information.

In addition to the standard format of returning one row for each column
found for the primary key, you can pass the C<pg_onerow> attribute to force
a single row to be used. If the primary key has multiple columns, the
"KEY_SEQ", "COLUMN_NAME", and "DATA_TYPE" fields will return a comma-delimited
string. If the C<pg_onerow> attribute is set to "2", the fields will be
returned as an arrayref, which can be useful when multiple columns are
involved:

  $sth = $dbh->primary_key_info('', '', 'dbd_pg_test', {pg_onerow => 2});
  if (defined $sth) {
    my $pk = $sth->fetchall_arrayref()->[0];
    print "Table $pk->[2] has a primary key on these columns:\n";
    for (my $x=0; defined $pk->[3][$x]; $x++) {
      print "Column: $pk->[3][$x]  (data type: $pk->[6][$x])\n";
    }
  }

=item B<primary_key>

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<foreign_key_info>

  $sth = $dbh->foreign_key_info( $pk_catalog, $pk_schema, $pk_table,
                                 $fk_catalog, $fk_schema, $fk_table );

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI, using the SQL/CLI variant.
This function returns C<undef> for PostgreSQL servers earlier than version
7.3. There are no search patterns allowed, but leaving the $schema argument
blank will cause the first table found in the schema search path to be
used. Two additional fields, "UK_DATA_TYPE" and "FK_DATA_TYPE", are returned
to show the data type for the unique and foreign key columns. Foreign
keys that have no named constraint (where the referenced column only has
an unique index) will return C<undef> for the "UK_NAME" field.

=item B<tables>

  @names = $dbh->tables( $catalog, $schema, $table, $type, \%attr );

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. This method returns all tables
and/or views which are visible to the current user: see C<table_info()>
for more information about the arguments. If the database is version 7.3
or later, the name of the schema appears before the table or view name. This
can be turned off by adding in the C<pg_noprefix> attribute:

  my @tables = $dbh->tables( '', '', 'dbd_pg_test', '', {pg_noprefix => 1} );

=item B<type_info_all>

  $type_info_all = $dbh->type_info_all;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. Information is only provided for
SQL datatypes and for frequently used datatypes. The mapping between the
PostgreSQL typename and the SQL92 datatype (if possible) has been done
according to the following table:

  +---------------+------------------------------------+

L<pgbuiltin|pgbuiltin>.

=item B<type_info>

  @type_info = $dbh->type_info($data_type);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<quote>

  $sql = $dbh->quote($value, $data_type);

This module implements its own C<quote> method. In addition to the DBI method it
also doubles the backslash, because PostgreSQL treats a backslash as an escape
character.

B<NOTE:> The undocumented (and invalid) support for the C<SQL_BINARY> data
type is officially deprecated. Use C<PG_BYTEA> with C<bind_param()> instead:

  $rv = $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value,
                         { pg_type => DBD::Pg::PG_BYTEA });


=item B<pg_server_trace>

  $dbh->pg_server_trace($filehandle);

Writes debugging information from the PostgreSQL backend to a file. This is 
not the same as the trace() method and you should not use this method unless 
you know what you are doing. If you do enable this, be aware that the file 
will grow very large, very quick. To stop logging to the file, use the 
C<pg_server_untrace> function. The first argument must be a file handle, not 
a filename. Example:

  my $pid = $dbh->{pg_pid};
  my $file = "pgbackend.$pid.debug.log";
  open(my $fh, ">$file") or die qq{Could not open "$file": $!\n};
  $dbh->pg_server_trace($fh);
  ## Run code you want to trace here
  $dbh->pg_server_untrace;
  close($fh);

=item B<pg_server_untrace>

  $dbh->pg_server_untrace

Stop server logging to a previously opened file.

=head2 Database Handle Attributes

=over 4

=item B<AutoCommit>  (boolean)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. According to the classification of
DBI, PostgreSQL is a database in which a transaction must be explicitly
started. Without starting a transaction, every change to the database becomes
immediately permanent. The default of AutoCommit is on, but this may change 
in the future, so it is highly recommended that you explicitly set it when 
calling C<connect()>. For details see the notes about B<Transactions> 
elsewhere in this document.

=item B<Driver>  (handle)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<Name>  (string, read-only)

The default DBI method is overridden by a driver specific method that returns
only the database name. Anything else from the connection string is stripped
off. Note that, in contrast to the DBI specs, the DBD::Pg implementation fo
this method is read-only.

=item B<RowCacheSize>  (integer)

Implemented by DBI, not used by this driver.

=item B<pg_auto_escape> (boolean)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. If true, then quotes and backslashes in all
parameters will be escaped in the following way:

  escape quote with a quote (SQL)
  escape backslash with a backslash

The default is on. Note that PostgreSQL also accepts quotes that are
escaped by a backslash. Any other ASCII character can be used directly in a
string constant.

=item B<pg_enable_utf8> (boolean)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. If true, then the C<utf8> flag will be turned
for returned character data (if the data is valid UTF-8). For details about
the C<utf8> flag, see L<Encode|Encode>. This attribute only relevant under
perl 5.8 and later.

B<NB>: This attribute is experimental and may be subject to change.

=item B<pg_INV_READ> (integer, read-only)

Constant to be used for the mode in C<lo_creat> and C<lo_open>.

=item B<pg_INV_WRITE> (integer, read-only)

Constant to be used for the mode in C<lo_creat> and C<lo_open>.

=item B<pg_bool_tf> (boolean)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. If true, boolean values will be returned
as the characters 't' and 'f' instead of '1' and '0'.

=item B<pg_errorlevel> (integer)

PostgreSQL specific attribute, only works for servers version 7.4 and above. 
Sets the amount of information returned by the server's error messages. 
Valid entries are 1,2, and 3. Any other number will be forced to the default 
value of 2.

A value of 0 ("TERSE") will show severity, primary text, and position only 
and will usually fit on a single line. A value of 1 ("DEFAULT") will also 
show any detail, hint, or context fields. A value of 2 ("VERBOSE") will 
show all available information.

=item B<pg_protocol> (integer, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the version of the PostgreSQL server.
If DBD::Pg is unable to figure out the version (e.g. it was compiled
against pre 7.4 libraries), it will return a "0". Otherwise, servers below
version 7.4 return a "2", and (currently) 7.4 and above return a "3".

=item B<pg_db> (string, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the name of the current database.

=item B<pg_user> (string, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the name of the user that
connected to the server.

=item B<pg_pass> (string, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the password used to connect
to the server.

=item B<pg_host> (string, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the host of the current
server connection. Locally connected hosts will return an empty
string.

=item B<pg_port> (integer, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the port of the connection to
the server.

=item B<pg_options> (string, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the command-line options passed
to the server. May be an empty string.

=item B<pg_socket> (number, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the file description number of
the connection socket to the server.

=item B<pg_pid> (number, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. Returns the process id (PID) of the
backend server process handling the connection.

=head1 DBI STATEMENT HANDLE OBJECTS

=head2 Statement Handle Methods

=over 4

=item B<bind_param>

  $rv = $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value, \%attr);

Allows the user to bind a value and/or a data type to a placeholder. This is
especially important when using the new server-side prepare system with
PostgreSQL 7.4. See the C<prepare()> method for more information.

The value of $param_num is a number if using the '?' or '$1' style
placeholders. If using ":foo" style placeholders, the complete name
(e.g. ":foo") must be given. For numeric values, you can either use a
number or use a literal '$1'. See the examples below.

The $bind_value argument is fairly self-explanatory. A value of C<undef> will
bind a C<NULL> to the placeholder. Using C<undef> is useful when you want
to change just the type and will be overwriting the value later.
(Any value is actually usable, but C<undef> is easy and efficient).

The %attr hash is used to indicate the data type of the placeholder.
The default value is "varchar". If you need something else, you must
use one of the values provided by DBI or by DBD::Pg. To use a SQL value,
modify your "use DBI" statement at the top of your script as follows:

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);

This will import some constants into your script. You can plug those
directly into the C<bind_param> call. Some common ones that you will
encounter are:

  SQL_INTEGER

To use PostgreSQL data types, import the list of values like this:

  use DBD::Pg qw(:pg_types);

You can then set the data types by setting the value of the C<pg_type>
key in the hash passed to C<bind_param>.

Data types are "sticky," in that once a data type is set to a certain placeholder,
it will remain for that placeholder, unless it is explicitly set to something
else afterwards. If the statement has already been prepared, and you switch the
data type to something else, DBD::Pg will re-prepare the statement for you before
doing the next execute.

Examples:

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
  use DBD::Pg qw(:pg_types);

  $SQL = "SELECT id FROM ptable WHERE size > ? AND title = ?";
  $sth = $dbh->prepare($SQL);

  ## Both arguments below are bound to placeholders as "varchar"
  $sth->execute(123, "Merk");

  ## Reset the datatype for the first placeholder to an integer
  $sth->bind_param(1, undef, SQL_INTEGER);

  ## The "undef" bound above is not used, since we supply params to execute
  $sth->execute(123, "Merk");

  ## Set the first placeholder's value and data type
  $sth->bind_param(1, 234, { pg_type => PG_TIMESTAMP });

  ## Set the second placeholder's value and data type.
  ## We don't send a third argument, so the default "varchar" is used
  $sth->bind_param("$2", "Zool");

  ## We realize that the wrong data type was set above, so we change it:
  $sth->bind_param("$1", 234, { pg_type => PG_INTEGER });

  ## We also got the wrong value, so we change that as well.
  ## Because the data type is sticky, we don't need to change it
  $sth->bind_param(1, 567);

  ## This executes the statement with 567 (integer) and "Zool" (varchar)
  $sth->execute();

=item B<bind_param_inout>

Currently not supported by this driver.

=item B<execute>

  $rv = $sth->execute(@bind_values);

Executes a previously prepared statement. In addition to C<UPDATE>, C<DELETE>,
C<INSERT> statements, for which it returns always the number of affected rows,
the C<execute> method can also be used for C<SELECT ... INTO table> statements.

The "prepare/bind/execute" process has changed significantly for PostgreSQL
servers 7.4 and later: please see the C<prepare()> and C<bind_param()> entries for
much more information.

=item B<fetchrow_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<fetchrow_array>

  @ary = $sth->fetchrow_array;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<fetchrow_hashref>

  $hash_ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<fetchall_arrayref>

  $tbl_ary_ref = $sth->fetchall_arrayref;

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<finish>

  $rc = $sth->finish;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<rows>

  $rv = $sth->rows;

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. In contrast to many other drivers
the number of rows is available immediately after executing the statement.

=item B<bind_col>

  $rc = $sth->bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind, \%attr);

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<bind_columns>

  $rc = $sth->bind_columns(\%attr, @list_of_refs_to_vars_to_bind);

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<dump_results>

  $rows = $sth->dump_results($maxlen, $lsep, $fsep, $fh);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<blob_read>

  $blob = $sth->blob_read($id, $offset, $len);

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. Implemented by DBI but not
documented, so this method might change.

This method seems to be heavily influenced by the current implementation of
blobs in Oracle. Nevertheless we try to be as compatible as possible. Whereas
Oracle suffers from the limitation that blobs are related to tables and every
table can have only one blob (datatype LONG), PostgreSQL handles its blobs
independent of any table by using so-called object identifiers. This explains
why the C<blob_read> method is blessed into the STATEMENT package and not part of
the DATABASE package. Here the field parameter has been used to handle this
object identifier. The offset and len parameters may be set to zero, in which
case the driver fetches the whole blob at once.

Starting with PostgreSQL 6.5, every access to a blob has to be put into a
transaction. This holds even for a read-only access.

See also the PostgreSQL-specific functions concerning blobs, which are
available via the C<func> interface.

For further information and examples about blobs, please read the chapter
about Large Objects in the PostgreSQL Programmer's Guide at
L<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/largeobjects.html>.

=item B<NAME>  (array-ref, read-only)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<NAME_lc>  (array-ref, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<NAME_uc>  (array-ref, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<NAME_hash>  (hash-ref, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<NAME_lc_hash>  (hash-ref, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<NAME_uc_hash>  (hash-ref, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<TYPE>  (array-ref, read-only)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI

=item B<PRECISION>  (array-ref, read-only)

Supported by this driver. C<NUMERIC> types will return the precision. Types of
C<CHAR> and C<VARCHAR> will return their size (number of characters). Other
types will return the number of I<bytes>.

=item B<SCALE>  (array-ref, read-only)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. The only type
that will return a value currently is C<NUMERIC>.

=item B<NULLABLE>  (array-ref, read-only)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. This is only available for
servers version 7.3 and later. Others will return "2" for all columns.

=item B<CursorName>  (string, read-only)

Not supported by this driver. See the note about B<Cursors> elsewhere in this
document.

=item C<Database>  (dbh, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item C<ParamValues>  (hash ref, read-only)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI. If called before C<execute>, the
literal values passed in are returned. If called after C<execute>, then
the quoted versions of the values are shown.

=item B<Statement>  (string, read-only)

Supported by this driver as proposed by DBI.

=item B<RowCache>  (integer, read-only)

Not supported by this driver.

=item B<pg_size>  (array-ref, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. It returns a reference to an array of integer
values for each column. The integer shows the size of the column in
bytes. Variable length columns are indicated by -1.

=item B<pg_type>  (array-ref, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. It returns a reference to an array of strings
for each column. The string shows the name of the data_type.

=item B<pg_oid_status> (integer, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. It returns the OID of the last INSERT command.

=item B<pg_cmd_status> (integer, read-only)

PostgreSQL specific attribute. It returns the type of the last
command. Possible types are: "INSERT", "DELETE", "UPDATE", "SELECT".

=head1 FURTHER INFORMATION

=head2 Transactions

Transaction behavior is controlled via the C<AutoCommit> attribute. For a
complete definition of C<AutoCommit> please refer to the DBI documentation.

According to the DBI specification the default for C<AutoCommit> is a true
value. In this mode, any change to the database becomes valid immediately. Any
C<BEGIN>, C<COMMIT> or C<ROLLBACK> statements will be rejected. DBD::Pg
implements C<AutoCommit> by issuing a C<BEGIN> statement immediately before
executing a statement, and a C<COMMIT> afterwards.

=head2 Large Objects

This driver supports all largeobject functions provided by libpq via the
C<func> method. Please note that, starting with PostgreSQL 6.5, any access to
a large object -- even read-only large objects -- must to be put into a
transaction!

=head2 Cursors

Although PostgreSQL has a cursor concept, it has not been used in the current
implementation. Cursors in PostgreSQL can only be used inside a transaction
block. Because only one transaction block at a time is allowed, this would
have implied the restriction not to use any nested C<SELECT> statements. Hence
the C<execute> method fetches all data at once into data structures located in
the front-end application. This approach must to be considered when selecting
large amounts of data!

=head2 Datatype bool

The current implementation of PostgreSQL returns 't' for true and 'f' for
false. From the Perl point of view, this is a rather unfortunate
choice. DBD::Pg therefore translates the result for the C<BOOL> data type in a
Perlish manner: 'f' -> '0' and 't' -> '1'. This way the application does
not have to check the database-specific returned values for the data-type
C<BOOL> because Perl treats '0' as false and '1' as true. You may set the
C<pg_bool_tf> attribute to a true value to change the values back to 't' and
'f' if you wish.

Boolean values can be passed to PostgreSQL as TRUE, 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes' or
'1' for true and FALSE, 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no' or '0' for false.

=head2 Schema support

PostgreSQL version 7.3 introduced schema support. Note that the PostgreSQL
schema concept may differ from those of other databases. In a nutshell, a schema
is a named collection of objects within a single database. Please refer to the
PostgreSQL documentation for more details.

Currently, DBD::Pg does not provide explicit support for PostgreSQL schemas.
However, schema functionality may be used without any restrictions by
explicitly addressing schema objects, e.g.

  my $res = $dbh->selectall_arrayref("SELECT * FROM my_schema.my_table");

or by manipulating the schema search path with C<SET search_path>, e.g.

  $dbh->do("SET search_path TO my_schema, public");
