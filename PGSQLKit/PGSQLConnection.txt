@abstract		A Connection class that is the root of all data access in 
PGSQLKit.  Contextually, the PGSQLConnection encapsulates a 
PQconnectdb() call and the results of that call.

@discussion	The PGSQLConnection class provides the gateway to all of the 
functionality in the library.  The only class that is not 
reached through the Connection class is the Login class, which 
is a utility class intended to provide an easy and reusable 
tool for obtaining a Connection class without reinventing the
login panel in every application.

The core functionality of this class wraps around the libpq 
interface.

@abstract		PGSQLConnection is the core class in the Kit.  Using the 
PGSQLConnection to create and use a database connection to 
execute queries and return results from the database, everything
else in the kit stems from this core class.
@discussion	The usual use of this class is to create a connection that is 
used for the duration of the connection.  A single connection 
can support multiple queries, however, because of local storage
of the results, it is possible that memory could become a 
concern if mulitple result sets are open as the same time.
